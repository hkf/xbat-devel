%    [h0,h1] = filt_daub(n,t); 
%
%    Function computes the Daubechies' scaling and wavelet filters
%    (normalized to sqrt(2)).
%
%    Input: 
%       n    : Length of filter (must be even)
%       t : Optional parameter that distinguishes the minimum phase,
%              maximum phase and mid-phase solutions ('min', 'max', or
%              'mid'). If no argument is specified, the minimum phase
%              solution is used.
%
%    Output: 
%       h0 : Minimal phase Daubechies' scaling filter 
%       h1 : Minimal phase Daubechies' wavelet filter 
%
%    Example:
%       n = 4;
%       t = 'min';
%       [h0,h1] = filt_daub(n,t)
%       h0 = 0.4830 0.8365 0.2241 -0.1294
%       h1 = 0.1294 0.2241 -0.8365 0.4830
