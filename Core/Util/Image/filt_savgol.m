function [NamesCoefs, NamesTerms, XPow, YPow, SG] = filt_savgol(nOrder,nSize)

% Compute Savitzky-Golay coefficients
% John Krumm, Microsoft Research, August 2001
% Requires MatLabSymbolic Math Toolbox
% On return:
% NamesCoefs(i,:) gives the name of coefficient i, e.g. a23
% NamesTerms(i,:) gives the name of the polynomial term i, e.g. (x^2)(y^3)
% XPow(i) and YPow(i) give exponents on x and y for coefficient i
% SG(:,:,i) gives the nSize x nSize filter for computing coefficient i
