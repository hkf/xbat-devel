function fun = sound_attribute

% NOTE: consider reuse of the 'param_fun' api structure, attributes are
% sort of parameters, susceptible to: creation, compilation, and control,
% the controls can take options and have a callback that represents the
% attribute model. What is the relation between preset store and load with
% read and write?
