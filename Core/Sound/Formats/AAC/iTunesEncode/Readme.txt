  Non-tagging options:
  -i <filename>    Specifies the input file. The input file can be
                   of any format iTunes can read.
                   (WAV, AIFF, M4A, MP3, WMA)

  -o <filename>    Specifies an output file. The resulting encoded
                   file will be copied here after encoding and
                   tagging are complete.

  -s <delay>       Delay to use in milliseconds (default: 4000).
                   Increase this if you experience problems
                   using iTunesEncode on long batch encodes.

  -e EncoderName   Lets you specify the encoder iTunes will use.
                   Choose from "AAC Encoder", "WAV Encoder",
                   "MP3 Encoder", "AIFF Encoder",
                   or "Lossless Encoder".
                   (Default is "AAC Encoder".)

  -d   This switch will make the program delete the song from
       the iTunes library once encoding and copying are complete.

Non-tag option notes:
-If you don't have an output specified, then the output
 won't be copied anywhere, and so using -d would be a bad idea.

-If the output file exists, it will be overwritten.




Suggested EAC Config string:
-e "AAC Encoder" -a "%a" -l "%g" -t "%t" -g "%m" -y %y -n %n -i %s -o %d

Suggested CDEx config string:
-e "AAC Encoder" -a "%a" -l "%b" -t "%t" -g "%g" -y "%y" -n "%tn" -c "iTunes AAC Encoder" -i %1 -o %2 -d

Suggested AudioGrabber config string:
-e "AAC Encoder" -a "%1" -l "%2" -t "%4" -g "%7" -y "%6" -n "%3" -i %s -o %d




Extra notes:

Note regarding the output file:
You may have noticed that the output file is optional. When iTunes converts a file, it adds the new file to its own library. This means a copy of the file exists in whatever location the iTunes library is. If you don't specify an output file, then all this is doing is leaving it wherever iTunes puts it. If you do specify an output file, then what's actually happening is that this program asks iTunes where that converted file is and then copies it to your output file. So there will be two copies of the file then. You can use the -d option to tell iTunes to delete the first copy and its library entry, if you like.


Note regarding the output file 2: 
If you specify and output file, and the output file exists, it will be overwritten.


Note regarding use of the -d option:
If you don't have an output specified, then the output won't be copied anywhere, and so using -d would be a bad idea. Because what would happen would be that it would encode the file, not copy it anywhere, and tell iTunes to delete it. Not particularly useful, I feel. :)


Note regarding options:
Any options above with spaces in them need to be surrounded by quotation marks. If they don't have spaces, they don't need quotation marks. Like this example:

iTunesEncode.exe -a "Artist Name" -t "Song Title" -l Album -y 2004 -i input.wav -o output.m4a


Note regarding options 2:
The options, including -i and -o and such, can be in any order.


Note regarding the input file:
The input file type can be any file type that iTunes can read. This includes WAV's, MP3's, M4A's, probably even unprotected WMA files.
