% [N names IDs] = num_channels(ai_obj)
%
% ai_obj - a standard data acquisition toolbox analog input object
%
% N - the number of available channels
%
% names - the names of each channel, in a cell array
%
% IDs - channel identifiers, the channel IDs are guarateed to be unique and
% have similar indexing properties for all analog input adapter types.
