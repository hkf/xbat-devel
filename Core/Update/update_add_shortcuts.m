% TODO: consolidated sounds, this seems to require significant sound updates

% NOTE: the main advantage of consolidated sounds is that the library can be moved easily

% NOTE: how about consolidated libraries, should libraries be held anywhere

% TODO: implement library aliases in some kind of user update
