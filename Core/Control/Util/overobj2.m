function g = over_obj(type)

%OVEROBJ Get handle of object the pointer is over.
%   H = OVEROBJ(TYPE) check searches visible objects of type TYPE in
%   the PointerWindow looking for one that is under the pointer.  It
%   returns the handle to the first object it finds under the pointer
%   or else the empty matrix.
%
%   Notes:
%   Assumes root units are pixels
%   Only works with object types that are children of figure
