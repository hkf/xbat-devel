% This function can be generalized to the case of measuring
% how distant other variables, linking features, are with
% respect to the graph of another, or even to their own graph,
% for example in this way we may determine if we can tighten
% the linking interval

% Sensitivity analysis of the linking interval is definitely
% an interesting thing to do, it is not clear yet what is the
% mathematical statement behind this
